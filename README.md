# Lexdata

This rust library is designed to produce compact lexical
representations of various data types.

## Roadmap

The roadmap of data types which Lexdata intends to support and which
are already implemented are:

- [x] Large integers (GMP)
- [ ] Large Floats
- [ ] Dates
- [ ] Rationals

## Discussion

More discussion on the strategies used, and how they are implemented
can be found in our discussion in TerminusDB on [Lexical
representation of data
types](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-store/blob/main/docs/LEXICAL.md).
